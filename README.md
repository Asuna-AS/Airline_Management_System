# Airline_Management_System
Airline management system we have developed is a solution to business and financial problems in one platform. Accessibility, ease of use and light resource dependency were the main issues of focus that were undertaken during the entire design phase of our project. The Graphical User Interface is extremely user friendly and the users can easily navigate through the platform to access its different features. The system is designed and built in such a way that it can be used to manage the airline bookings/ cancellations and can be handled by any end user scenario, that is, by customers or admins.

# JAVA properties that were used
1.) Java awt.swing; package - for the user interface
2.) JDBC - linker to database
3.) SQL database software to manage data
4.) Java object oriented methodology (inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation)

# Real world applications of our project
Airline management systems (AMS) are systems that allow an airline to sell their inventory (seats). It contains information on schedules and fares and contains a database of reservations (or passenger name records) and of tickets issued (if applicable). AMSâ€™ are part of passenger service systems (PSS), which are applications supporting the direct contact with the passenger.

# Conclusion
This project has been very helpful to each one of us to learn teamwork and make a real world application-based product which has the potential to help people and make the process of ticket reservation hassle-free.
We learned many new concepts and their application through this project. We learned a new aspect of java programming which is UI designing by using Swing and database management through JDBC.
